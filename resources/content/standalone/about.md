I believe in living a life filled with intention. I don't want my habits to control me, nor do I want to define myself by my limitations. This blog is dedicated to a wild idea: What would happen if I write an essay on every YouTube video that I watch? Whether I can maintain this madness or burn up in the attempt, I hope you can come along for the ride. Who knows? Maybe I will inspire you to do the same.</div>
